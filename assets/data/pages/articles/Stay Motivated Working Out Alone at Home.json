  "introduction": {
    "hook": "Day 43. That's how long my longest home workout streak lasted before I discovered the systems I'm about to share with you. I'd start strong, full of motivation and grand plans, then slowly watch my enthusiasm fade until I was making excuses and skipping workouts.",
    "personalStory": "The pattern was always the same: Week 1 - on fire, working out daily. Week 2 - still going strong, maybe missing one day. Week 3 - starting to make excuses. Week 4 - maybe 2 workouts total. Week 5 - back to zero, feeling like a failure.",
    "credibility": "I tried everything: expensive workout programs, motivational videos, reward systems, punishment systems. Nothing stuck. The problem wasn't my willpower or discipline‚Äîit was that I was relying on motivation instead of building systems.",
    "promise": "That was 2 years and 3 months ago. Since then, I've worked out at home consistently 4-5 times per week, missed only 12 workout days total (all due to illness), and built the strongest, most confident version of myself I've ever been. Here's exactly how I cracked the code on solo workout motivation."
