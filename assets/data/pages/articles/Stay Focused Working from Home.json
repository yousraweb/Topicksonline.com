  "introduction": {
    "hook": "Six months ago, I had the focus span of a caffeinated squirrel. Working from home had turned me into a master procrastinator who could find seventeen different ways to avoid a simple task. My kitchen suddenly needed deep cleaning during important deadlines. I became an expert on my neighbors' daily routines.",
    "personalStory": "The breaking point came when I spent 4 hours 'working' on a 30-minute task because I kept getting distracted by everything from social media notifications to the fascinating pattern of sunlight on my wall. I was getting paid to work from home, but I was barely working at all.",
    "credibility": "So I did what any obsessive productivity nerd would do: I spent 6 months systematically testing every focus strategy I could find. I tracked my deep work hours, measured my task completion rates, and documented what actually moved the needle versus what just felt productive.",
    "promise": "Here are the 12 strategies that transformed my chaotic work-from-home existence into a focused, productive routine. Some will surprise you. Others might seem obvious but have crucial implementation details that make all the difference."
