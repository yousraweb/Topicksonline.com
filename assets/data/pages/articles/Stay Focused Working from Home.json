Working from home had turned me into a master procrastinator who could find seventeen different ways to avoid a simple task. My kitchen suddenly needed deep cleaning during important deadlines.

But here's the crucial part: you don't need all 12 strategies. Start with 2-3 that resonate most with your specific challenges. Master those for a month, then add others gradually. The goal isn't to become a productivity robot—it's to create sustainable focus habits that let you do your best work without burning out. Some strategies will click immediately. Others might feel forced or unnatural for your work style. That's perfectly normal. The key is experimenting with intention and tracking what actually works for you, not what works for productivity gurus on social media. What's your biggest focus challenge while working from home? Which of these strategies sounds most promising for your situation? I'd love to hear about your experiments and results in the comments below. Focus is a skill, and like any skill, it improves with deliberate practice."
