  "description": "Grocery prices are insane, but you can still eat well on $50/week. This is the exact meal plan I used for 3 months when money was tight—real recipes, real prices, real food that doesn't taste like punishment.",
  "introduction": {
    "hook": "Last year, I had to cut my grocery budget from $120/week to $50/week practically overnight. My freelance income dropped by 60%, and food was one of the few expenses I could control immediately. I was terrified I'd be eating ramen noodles and peanut butter sandwiches for months.",
    "personalStory": "Instead, I discovered something amazing: with the right strategy, $50 can buy you real, satisfying meals that don't taste like poverty food. I'm not talking about surviving on rice and beans (though they make appearances). I'm talking about actual flavor, variety, and meals you'd be happy to serve to friends.",
    "credibility": "I lived on this meal plan for 3 months, tracking every penny and perfecting every recipe. I lost 8 pounds (in a good way), discovered I'm actually a decent cook, and saved over $900 that helped me get back on my feet financially.",
    "promise": "Here's the exact 7-day meal plan that kept me fed, satisfied, and sane during the toughest financial period of my adult life. Every ingredient is chosen for maximum versatility and flavor impact."
