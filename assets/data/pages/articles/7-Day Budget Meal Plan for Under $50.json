This meal plan got me through the toughest financial period of my life without sacrificing my health or sanity. It can do the same for you. Remember: this is temporary. Whether you're between jobs, paying off debt, or just trying to save money, tight budgets don't last forever. But the cooking skills and money management habits you develop will serve you for life. Start with week one, stick to the list, and don't be afraid to adapt based on what's on sale at your local store. You've got this."
