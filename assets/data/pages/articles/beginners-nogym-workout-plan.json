  "description": "Stop drowning in expensive gym memberships you never use. After 6 months of testing home workout routines and spending $0 on equipment, here's the 4-week plan that actually got me fit at home.",
  "introduction": {
    "hook": "Six months ago, I was that person paying $60/month for a gym membership I used exactly three times. Between commute time, intimidating equipment, and crowded peak hours, I always found an excuse to stay home on the couch.",
    "personalStory": "The breaking point came when I calculated I'd spent $720 in a year for basically nothing. I was scrolling through Instagram fitness influencers, feeling guilty about my unused gym card, when I realized something obvious: I don't need a gym to get in shape.",
    "credibility": "So I did what any determined (and slightly obsessive) person would do: I spent 6 months testing every home workout routine I could find, tracking my progress with photos and measurements, and documenting what actually worked for a complete beginner.",
    "promise": "Here's what I learned: 90% of fitness advice assumes you have equipment, experience, or unlimited time. But this 4-week plan? It requires nothing but floor space and 20-30 minutes, 4 times per week. No excuses, no equipment, no gym anxiety."
