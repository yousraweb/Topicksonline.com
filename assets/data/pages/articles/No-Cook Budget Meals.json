  "description": "Whether it's heat, laziness, or no kitchen ‚Äî this is your fix. After 3 months with a broken stove and a $50/week food budget, here are 7 no-cook meals that saved my sanity and wallet.",
  "introduction": {
    "hook": "It was 97¬∞F outside, my ancient window AC unit had died, and my landlord informed me the stove repair would take 'at least two weeks.' Standing in my sweltering studio apartment, exhausted from a 12-hour work day, the last thing I wanted to do was generate more heat by cooking.",
    "personalStory": "That was three months ago. Between the broken stove, summer heat waves, and working 60-hour weeks, I became an accidental expert in no-cook meals. Not by choice‚Äîby necessity. My food budget was $50/week, I had no energy for elaborate meal prep, and ordering takeout every day wasn't an option.",
    "credibility": "What started as survival mode became a revelation. I discovered that some of my favorite, most satisfying meals required zero cooking, cost under $3 per serving, and took less than 10 minutes to assemble. Even now that my stove is fixed, I still make these no-cook meals 4-5 times per week.",
    "promise": "Whether you're dealing with a broken stove, oppressive heat, complete exhaustion, a dorm room with no kitchen, or just pure laziness, these 7 meals will save you. They've been tested by my college roommate (tiny dorm), my sister (new mom with no energy), and my friend Jake (broken AC, refuses to turn on oven in summer)."
