      "content": "After 18 months of working out in my 36-square-foot bedroom corner, here's what I've learned: you don't need a perfect space to start building a fitness habit. You need a functional space that removes barriers and makes exercise feel accessible. I've worked out consistently in three different small spaces, helped five friends create their own setups, and spent a total of $73 on equipment that still works perfectly today. The magic isn't in having the perfect home gym—it's in having a space that's ready when you are. When your workout space is set up and inviting, you'll naturally exercise more often. When it's a hassle to access your gear or clear your space, you'll find excuses to skip workouts. Your space doesn't need to be Instagram-worthy. It needs to be yours, functional, and ready for action in under 5 minutes. Start with clearing 6x6 feet of floor space and a yoga mat. Everything else can be added as you build the habit and identify what you actually need. The best home gym is the one you actually use. What's your biggest challenge with creating a workout space in your current living situation? Share your small space solutions in the comments—I love hearing creative approaches to making fitness work anywhere."
