  "introduction": {
    "hook": "Three times. That's how many times I started a home fitness routine with massive enthusiasm, only to quit within 2-3 weeks feeling defeated, sore, and convinced that 'fitness just isn't for me.'",
    "personalStory": "The breaking point came during my fourth attempt when I pulled my lower back doing what I thought were 'easy' bodyweight exercises. Lying on my couch with a heating pad, I realized I wasn't failing because I lacked willpower‚ÄîI was making the same preventable mistakes over and over again.",
    "credibility": "I spent 8 months studying what actually works, tracking my mistakes obsessively, and testing different approaches. I interviewed personal trainers, analyzed my failed attempts, and finally figured out why 90% of home fitness beginners quit within a month.",
    "promise": "Here's what I discovered: success isn't about motivation or genetics. It's about avoiding 7 specific mistakes that sabotage progress before you even get started."
