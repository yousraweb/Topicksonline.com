It's about progress, consistency, and patience. Every mistake I made was preventable with the right information and realistic expectations. You don't need perfect genetics, unlimited time, or expensive equipment to succeed with home fitness. You need to avoid these 7 common mistakes that sabotage 90% of beginners before they see real results. Progress equals consistency plus patience. Not perfection plus intensity. Start small, focus on form, take rest days, set realistic expectations, ignore the comparison trap, support your workouts with basic nutrition, and think lifestyle change, not quick fix. Which of these 7 mistakes resonates most with your experience? Have you fallen into any of these traps? I'd love to hear your story and what you learned from your own fitness journey in the comments below."
