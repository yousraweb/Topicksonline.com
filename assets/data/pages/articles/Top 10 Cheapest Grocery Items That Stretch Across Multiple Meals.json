Each item on this list can become 5-10 different meals depending on how you prepare it. Stop buying single-use ingredients that only work for one recipe. Start building a pantry of versatile workhorses that adapt to your mood, budget, and what's available. Cook smart, not expensive. Your wallet will thank you, and you might discover you're a better cook than you thought. Which of these ingredients will you experiment with first? I'd love to hear about your creative budget meal discoveries in the comments below."
