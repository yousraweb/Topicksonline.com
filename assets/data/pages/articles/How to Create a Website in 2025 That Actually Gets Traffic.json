After three months, I had exactly 47 total visitors—and 23 of them were me checking if it was working. I was doing everything the tutorials said but missing the fundamental strategies that actually drive traffic."

The difference wasn't luck or some secret hack—it was understanding what actually matters when creating a website in 2025."

      "content": "**WordPress + Hostinger (My Top Recommendation):** Most flexible platform, thousands of themes, works with all the best plugins, costs about $30 per year total. This is what I use for all my successful websites. Takes about 2 hours to set up completely."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "**Shopify:** Perfect if you're selling physical products, built-in payment processing, professional e-commerce features. But it's $29/month and overkill if you're blogging or doing affiliate marketing."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "**Webflow:** Gorgeous designs, no coding required, perfect for creative portfolios. But it's expensive ($12-36/month) and has a steep learning curve. Better for designers than beginners."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "**Squarespace:** Beautiful templates, easy to use, good for creative businesses. But limited customization and $12/month. Fine for simple sites but restrictive as you grow."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "My recommendation? Start with Hostinger + WordPress. It's what powers 43% of all websites, costs less than $3/month, and you can always upgrade later. I've launched 6 successful sites on this combination."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "Keep your initial costs low. Your money is better spent on content creation and promotion than premium hosting. Once you're making $500/month from your site, then consider upgrading."

The technical stuff is easier than ever—the hard part is staying consistent when growth feels slow. Your audience is out there searching for exactly what you have to offer. The only question is whether you'll create something valuable enough for them to stay, subscribe, and recommend to others. Start with helping one person solve one problem, then scale from there. That's how every successful website begins."
