This 4-week plan isn't about dramatic transformation—it's about building sustainable habits that improve your health, energy, and confidence. The hardest part isn't the exercises; it's showing up consistently. But once you do, you'll discover what I did: fitness isn't about punishment or perfection. It's about feeling strong, energized, and proud of what your body can do. Your home gym is waiting. Your stronger, healthier self is just 4 weeks away. What's stopping you from starting today?"
