    "personalStory": "After 18 months of aggressive grocery experimentation, I discovered something powerful: there are exactly 10 ingredients that can transform from breakfast to lunch to dinner, stretch for days, and cost less than a single restaurant meal. These aren't just 'cheap foods'—they're culinary chameleons that prevent food boredom while keeping your wallet happy.",
    "credibility": "I tracked every purchase, timed every meal prep, and documented every creative use I could think of. The result? I was eating better than friends who spent 3x my grocery budget, and I actually learned to cook in the process.",
