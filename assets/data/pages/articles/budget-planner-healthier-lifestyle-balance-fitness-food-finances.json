    "personalStory": "Picture this: me, convinced that healthy living required a $200 monthly gym membership, $150 weekly Whole Foods hauls, and a $89 monthly supplement subscription. Three months later, I was broke, stressed about money, and ironically less healthy than when I started because I couldn't afford to keep it up.",
    "credibility": "That financial wake-up call forced me to create a realistic budget planner that actually works for people who don't have unlimited money. I've now maintained a healthy lifestyle for 18 months on $300 per month total - less than what I used to spend weekly.",
    "promise": "This budget planner will show you exactly how to eat healthy, stay fit, and maintain your sanity without choosing between your health and your rent money."
