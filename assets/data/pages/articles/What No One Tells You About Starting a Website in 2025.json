      "content": "Let me be brutally honest with you. I've launched 12 websites in the past three years. Eight of them are collecting digital dust. The other four? They're actually making money and helping people. The difference wasn't the fancy themes or expensive tools—it was understanding what everyone conveniently leaves out of their tutorials."

      "content": "You see, in 2025, creating a website takes about 20 minutes with AI tools like Framer AI or Webflow. But building something people actually care about? That's where most of us crash and burn. Here's what I wish someone had told me before I wasted 18 months on sites nobody visited."

      "content": "I spent my first $2,000 on a gorgeous custom design for a productivity blog. Clean lines, perfect typography, mobile-responsive—the works. Know how many subscribers I got in the first month? Twelve. And half of them were friends being polite."

      "content": "Meanwhile, my friend Sarah launched her finance blog using a free WordPress theme that looked like it was designed in 2018. But she had one thing I didn't: real credibility signals. Her 'About' page told her story of paying off $40K in debt. She shared actual bank screenshots (numbers blurred, obviously). She had testimonials from people she'd helped one-on-one before starting the blog."

The 3-2-1 SEO Strategy I Use: 3 minutes researching what people actually search for (I use Answer The Public—it's free), 2 long-tail keywords per article (like 'how to start a budget for beginners' instead of just 'budgeting'), 1 clear answer to the question in your first paragraph."

    {
      "type": "text",

But the ideas, stories, examples, and personality? That's all me. AI can help you work faster, but it can't replace your unique perspective and experiences."

Result? Same traffic level, but now earning $2,000+ per month. The difference was having a plan for what happens after someone reads your content."
