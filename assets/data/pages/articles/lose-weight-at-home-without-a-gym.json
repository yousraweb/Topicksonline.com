  "introduction": {
    "hook": "Two years ago, I stood in my bedroom trying on clothes that hadn't fit in months, frustrated and defeated. I had a $120/month gym membership that I used maybe twice. I owned workout DVDs I'd never opened and diet books I'd never finished reading.",
    "personalStory": "The breaking point came when I realized I'd spent over $2,000 on fitness memberships, supplements, and 'quick fix' programs in two years, yet I was heavier than when I started. I was 35 pounds overweight, exhausted all the time, and convinced that weight loss required expensive equipment and complicated meal plans.",
    "credibility": "That's when I decided to strip everything down to basics. No gym. No expensive supplements. No complicated protocols. Just me, my living room, and a commitment to understanding what actually creates fat loss.",
    "promise": "Six months later, I'd lost 35 pounds, gained energy I hadn't felt in years, and built sustainable habits that I've maintained for 18 months. Here's exactly how I did it‚Äîand how you can too."
